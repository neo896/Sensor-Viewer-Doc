# Position Preview

After adding or importing a sensor, you can browse a view of the sensor's location in the grid area of the software.By default, a coordinate called chassis is displayed, which represents the origin of the coordinate system of the car's chassis. Vehicle reference point is the center of the rear axle, X-axis: vehicle forward direction

## Coordinate System

We use a right-handed coordinate system, which you can see in the lower right corner of the grid area, where red, green, and blue represent the three axes X, Y, and Z, respectively.

The sensor also displays the coordinate pattern according to the corresponding color. In general, the red x-axis is the front direction, but sometimes we define the blue z-axis as the front direction, e.g. for cameras. It depends on how you define it and give matching parameters
